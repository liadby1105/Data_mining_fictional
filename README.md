# Data_mining_fictional

Call Sample.csv is a fictional dataset that manually recorded weekly averages of Service Time (in
seconds) and Quality Score (on a 10-point scale) reported across multiple sites, clients, supervisors, and
agents for five consecutive weeks. The key metrics weâ€™re interested in are Service Time and Quality
Score and the relationship between these and the remaining factors in the dataset. We would like to
understand any potential relationships that could be presented to the business for further investigation
and what probing questions derived from the data that we can ask the business to improve both metrics.

I requested to analyze this dataset and prepare a brief presentation of my analysis.
Assume audience includes both technical people (who understand statistics and data
science) and business members.
